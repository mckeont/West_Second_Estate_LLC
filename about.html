                    <h2>About Us</h2>
                    <p>Life has taken me through many chapters—each one preparing me for this moment. I started as a business owner, learning to build from the ground up. Becoming a homeowner taught me the power of ownership, and becoming a landlord showed me how to create cash flow.</p>

                    <p>As a mortgage lender, I helped others finance their dreams. Now, as a developer, I’m not just building homes—I’m building a future. My mission is clear: Black and Brown communities deserve more than just housing. They deserve safe, clean, and beautiful places to call home—neighborhoods designed for sustainability, opportunity, and legacy.</p>

                    <p>That’s why I’m redefining affordable housing for the 21st century. These aren’t just homes; they’re thoughtfully designed, energy-efficient spaces that adapt to modern living. With smart technology, dedicated work areas, and a focus on health and safety, we’re creating communities that uplift and empower.</p>

                    <p>This isn’t just about real estate. It’s about breaking generational cycles, creating opportunities, and leaving a lasting impact. I’ve helped families buy homes—now I’m developing entire communities. And this is just the beginning.</p>
